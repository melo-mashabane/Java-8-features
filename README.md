# Java version features
*Question*: Which Java version to learn and which to use?
*Answer*: Pending. Covering Java versions from 8 onwards.

Newer Java versions now follow every 6 months. Version 16 just has just been released March 2021, 17 schedlued for September 2021 and so on. In the past, Java release cycles were much longer, up to 3-5 years (good'ol days!)

# What are the differences between Java versions? Should I learn a specific one?
Java is extremely backwards compatible. This means that your Java 5 or 8 program is guaranteed to run with a Java 8-14 virtual machine - with a few exceptions - dont the pleb that has to dig something up (-_-).

This is how I see see it. Walk with me. **iWalk**:
You do not just "learn" a specific Java version, like 11 - anything above just....(-_-) ok. They are neat additions.
Rather, get a good foundation in all language features up until Java 8 (then you can start see the actual development in the language) This serves as a good base.

Pretty much all (-_-) **donâ€™t be picky now** Java 8 language features also work in Java 14. The same goes for all other Java versions in between.

Which in turns means that all language features from Java 8 serve as very good Java base knowledge and everything else (Java 9-14) is pretty much additional features on top of that baseline.
